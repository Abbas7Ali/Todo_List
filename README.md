## Todo List Website Project
## Overview
This Todo List website is a user-friendly application built with React.js and styled using Tailwind CSS. It allows users to efficiently manage their tasks by adding, editing, and deleting items on their to-do list. The application leverages local storage to persist tasks, ensuring that users can access their lists even after refreshing the page.

## Key Features

Task Management: Users can easily add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks they no longer need.
Local Storage: All tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, enabling data persistence across sessions without the need for a backend server.
Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Intuitive User Interface: The use of Tailwind CSS allows for a clean and modern interface, making it easy for users to navigate and manage their tasks.

**Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid styling and responsive design without leaving the HTML structure.
**Local Storage API:** A built-in web storage feature that allows the application to store data on the user's device.
